# :clipboard: Pascal.Algorithm

This repo will be the source of many type of algorithm with pascal

Pascal is a procedural programming language, designed in 1968 and 
published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth and named in honour of the French 
mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. Pascal runs on a variety of
platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and various versions of UNIX/Linux.

  > anyway pascal it's not bad language in my vision its just a old language without any cool features
  
## :bulb: The idea behind that

I am a computer science student

I have created this repo to practice some type of algorithm with pascal because my country 
use this programming language as default of computer science education 

## :exclamation: How it

In this repo i will push the pascal code with a documentation maybe in the code (I mean put it as comment in the code)


### Enjoy guys !
